# Content-Aware Image Resizing

A high-performance C# implementation of the Seam Carving algorithm for intelligent image resizing. This project provides an advanced solution for content-aware image manipulation while preserving critical visual elements.

## Overview

Content-Aware Resizing (Seam Carving) is a sophisticated image processing algorithm that performs intelligent pixel removal/addition based on image content analysis. The algorithm identifies and preserves regions of high visual importance while removing less significant areas, making it ideal for maintaining image integrity during resizing operations.

## Key Features

- Advanced content-aware image resizing with seam carving algorithm
- Sophisticated energy map computation for visual importance analysis
- Dynamic programming-based vertical seam detection and removal
- Comprehensive support for both RGB and grayscale image processing
- Real-time energy map visualization capabilities
- Optimized implementation with efficient memory management
- High-performance image processing using unsafe code blocks
- Robust error handling and input validation

## Technical Architecture

The implementation leverages several sophisticated components:

1. **Energy Calculation Engine**
   - Computes pixel energy based on RGB/grayscale differentials
   - Implements efficient gradient calculations
   - Supports both color and monochrome processing

2. **Seam Detection System**
   - Dynamic programming implementation for optimal seam identification
   - Efficient path cost computation
   - Robust seam validation and verification

3. **Image Processing Pipeline**
   - High-performance RGB and grayscale image handling
   - Efficient memory management using unsafe code blocks
   - Advanced bitmap manipulation capabilities

4. **Visualization Framework**
   - Real-time energy map rendering
   - Interactive seam path visualization
   - Progress tracking and result preview

## System Requirements

- .NET Framework 4.0 or higher
- System.Drawing namespace
- Windows Forms for visualization
- Minimum 2GB RAM recommended for large images
- Windows operating system

## Implementation

### Basic Usage

```csharp
// Initialize the content-aware resizer
var resizer = new ContentAwareResize("path/to/image.jpg");

// Perform content-aware resizing
resizer.RemoveColumns(numberOfColumnsToRemove);

// Access the processed image
MyColor[,] resizedImage = resizer._imageMatrix;
```

### Advanced Usage

```csharp
// Calculate and visualize energy map
int[,] energyMap = ImageOperations.CalculateEnergy(imageMatrix);
Utilities.DisplayEnergy(energyMap, pictureBox);

// Custom seam removal with progress tracking
resizer.CalculateVerIndexMap(numberOfSeams, ref minSeamValue, ref seamPath);
```
